# Wine-Quality-Prediction
This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the quality of wine based on physicochemical properties. The dataset includes features like acidity, alcohol content, sugar level, pH, and more. The model helps classify wine quality scores and can assist producers and analysts in quality control and product assessment.
